# guilded-bridge
Simple Guilded & Discord bridge, designed for WiiLink24.

Kinda bad code, but hey, it works. You should have some Python knowledge before using this.  
Rename the .env-example to .env and fill in the values.  
Make sure to install the deps with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and you can launch the Discord and Guilded bots seperately or use my Launch script (which you may have to modify if you use python3 instead of just python)
